What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you are adding the files and 
code necessasry for git to work with that folder. You 
need to do it so that git will work with the documents 
within that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value to you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and
the repository in that it is an area that allows you to 
do things before they become permanent.  The value it offers
is the ability to do work without making permanent changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

You can add all the files that are part of the logical change to the
staging area before you commit. That way they will all be included in
your commit. So when you compare them to previous or future changes
you will see all the changes logically necessary to understand
the change.
