When would you want to use a remote respository rather than keeping
all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you have a project
that has more than one person working on it.  Or it may be that
you want to have access to the file from different computers or
different locations and don't want to have to store the file 
locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

You might want to manually pull changes rather than automating this
because you have control over when changes are pulled. It might not
make sense to pull changes from remote at certain points in your
projects development. If the changes were pulled automatically, 
this would likely cause more problems than it solved.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone that you create on git hub, it clones one repo
on git hub into another repo on git hub. A clone is a copy of a 
repo on your local computer; the source either being from git hub
or from your local computer. A branch is a commit or commit history
that is separate from the master branch, because it branched off
from master at some point. A branch can exist either locally or 
on git hub within a repository.
